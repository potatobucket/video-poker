# Video Poker
A video poker program by potato_bucket Â© 2023

This project happened because I wanted to make a video poker app like those little LCD ones from when I was a kid back in the '90s. I tried to do it in Retro Gadgets but I couldn't make it happen so I moved to Godot because I'm slightly more comfortable coding in GDScript than I am in Lua. It took me three days to get discarding to work.
